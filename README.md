# CIFAR10-with-CNN

CIFAR Code Along with CNN
The CIFAR-10 dataset is similar to MNIST, except that instead of one color channel (grayscale) there are three channels (RGB).
Where an MNIST image has a size of (1,28,28), CIFAR images are (3,32,32). There are 10 categories an image may fall under:
0.airplane
1.automobile
2.bird
3.cat
4.deer
5.dog
6.frog
7.horse
8.ship
9.truck

As with the previous code along, make sure to watch the theory lectures! You'll want to be comfortable with:
convolutional layers
filters/kernels
pooling
depth, stride and zero-padding
